		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>My name is Soumya and I live in IL. I have been coding since the summer of 2020. I currently am in Elementry school. Right now I like to swim and exercise my brain by reading books. I have created lots of apps and youtube videos. They talk about some of my apps.
        Next year I am going to go to Gregory Middle School . I have one older sister.</p>
